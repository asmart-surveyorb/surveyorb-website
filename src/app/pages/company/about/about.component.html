          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Survey Orb was founded on a simple observation: collecting feedback is easy, but getting actionable insights from it is hard. Traditional survey tools generate data, but leave you to figure out what it means.</p>
          <p>We built Survey Orb to change that. By combining intuitive survey design with AI-powered analysis, we help teams move from data collection to decision-making faster than ever before.</p>
          <p>Today, thousands of organizations use Survey Orb to understand their customers, engage their employees, and make better decisions based on real feedback.</p>
